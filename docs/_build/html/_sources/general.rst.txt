Why should I use labelord?
===========================

Managing labels of one repository can be a pretty simple task, using the **GitHub** website features. But what if we have to manage several repositories? Wouldn't it be easier and faster to manage all of them at once?

That's the perfect use of **labelord**! It allows you to manage your labels in all of your specified **GitHub** repositories through a Flask web interface or command-line interface. All you have to do is perform your desired configuration, and then add new or modify existing labels.

**Labelord** will propagate the changes to all of your specified repositories for you!

Please proceed to `Installation <installation.html#section>`__.
